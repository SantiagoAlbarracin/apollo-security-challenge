# Apollo Security Challenge

This repository contains the solution to the security scripting challenge presented by Apollo.io.

## Usage
To execute the challenge script, run the Python script `security_scripting_challenge.py`. After completion, you'll find the generated output file named `output_requests_ips.json`, containing information on the number of requests per source IP.

Additionally, as part of the provided solution, the source IP involved in the incident must be blocked via API. In this case, the source IP `181.31.10.13` has been successfully blocked via API. You can review the details of this action in the file `blocked_ip_post.jpg`.
